              love.

              But there are practical matters to consider before bringing a pet
              into your home, above and beyond simply providing food, water and
              shelter.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>We want your adoption to succeed.</strong> So before
              adopting a cat or dog
              <span style="text-decoration: underline">please</span> take some
              time to ask yourself the following questions:
            </p>
            <h4>Is the timing right for you and your family?</h4>
            <p>
              Adopting a new pet is a <strong>lifetime commitment</strong>,
              which can mean up to 15-20 years for a puppy or kitten. Think
              ahead as to how your new friend will fit into your future, as well
              as into your present situation. Lifestyle changes such as moving
              or the birth of children can be hard to predict, but considering
              what may happen down the road can help you select the right pet
              now.
            </p>
            <h4>Are you ready for the expenses?</h4>
            <p>
              The love a newly-adopted pet provides is priceless; keeping them
              happy and healthy is not. The <strong>cost</strong>&nbsp;of food,
              veterinary care, spaying or neutering, grooming, and proper
              identification (a collar with tags and/or a more permanent form of
              ID, such as micro-chipping) can add up. Are you willing and able
              to cover those costs?
            </p>
            <h4>How much attention can you give your new pet?</h4>
            <p>
              Most dogs enjoy several hours of exercise and
              <strong>companionship</strong> every day. Cats are healthiest and
              happiest when kept indoors, so exercise is usually not an issue,
              but most still love to play and spend time with you. If your work
              demands that you travel often, or if you’re out of the house most
              days and evenings, you will have to make arrangements to ensure
              your new pet gets the enrichment he or she needs.
            </p>
            <h4>Will your new pet fit in with your family?</h4>
            <p>
              Make sure all members of your family, both the two-legged and
              four-legged kind, can <strong>accommodate the addition</strong> of
              a new cat or dog to your household. Consider everyone’s
              personality, health and level of responsibility in your choice.

              <h3>&nbsp;Questions to Ask a Guardian</h3>

                />
              </p>
            </div>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>How did you get your pet?</strong> It’s always good to
                know the pet’s full history.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>How long have you had your pet?</strong> If the pet has
                only been with the current Guardian a short time, see if you can
                get the previous owner’s contact information.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Why do you need to find your pet a new home?</strong> Be
                understanding of the situation. You never know what someone is
                going through, and the fact that they are trying to find their
                pet a new home instead of resorting to a shelter shows that they
                care.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>What is your pet’s favorite thing to do?</strong>
                Knowing the cat or dog’s favorite activities will help smooth
                the transition immensely.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Is your pet scared of anything?</strong> For instance:
                thunderstorms, fireworks, loud noises, car rides, trips to the
                vet, people in uniforms, children or other animals.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Does your pet have any allergies?</strong> You’ll want
                to know what, if anything, to avoid sharing with your new
                friend.
              </li>
              <br />

              <li>
                <strong>Does your pet have any medical conditions?</strong>
                Learn everything you can about the pet’s medical history, and
                get copies of any veterinary documents, if possible.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <strong>Has your pet ever had any behavioral issues?</strong>
                Make sure to ask specifics like, “Have they ever shown
                aggression to a person or another animal?” or “Have they ever
                urinated inappropriately in your house?” Don’t worry about
                things that are specific to puppies or kittens, like play-biting
                or accidents in the house prior to house training. Ask things
                that are relevant to your lifestyle, such as, “Do&nbsp;they bark
                at new people? Will they&nbsp;stay with you without a leash?
                Do&nbsp;they chase squirrels and other outdoor animals?”
